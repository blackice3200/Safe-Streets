Software Engineering Mandatory Project 19/20 - SafeStreets
In the modern era, the availability and use of smart devices is at an alltime high, this
has lead to the development of a large number of applications to help people,
companies and governments make their daily routines easier and more efficient. The
traffic management sector is no exception. SafeStreets is a company that is trying to
help, citizens and municipalities, make cities safer and more organized places in
terms of traffic accidents and violations.
SafeStreets uses their application to allow the general public to report traffic
violations in terms of type of accident (i.e. double parking), location, and time and
date. Furthermore, users can see statistics about the general safety of areas.
SafeStreets uses their website to allow municipalities to view raw data about
violations reported by users (useful for identifying repeat offenders, ticketing, etc.. ).
In addition, municipalities receive feedback from SafeStreets about what can be done
to improve the safety of identified problem areas in the city
